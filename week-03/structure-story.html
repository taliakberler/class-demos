    <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook listens as President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting about cybersecurity in the East Room of the White House, Aug. 25, 2021.</p>

    <p>It pays to be the leader of Apple.</p>

    <p>The company's CEO, Tim Cook, was recently given a bonus of $750 million worth of Apple stock, marking his 10th anniversary as CEO.</p>

    <p>The bonus was revealed Thursday in a regulatory filing.</p>

    <p>He promptly cashed out the 5 million shares, which were given based on both performance and time with the company.</p>

    <p>The bonus plan was put in place after Cook had become CEO in 2011, shortly before the death of company co-founder Steve Jobs.</p>

    <p>Since Cook took over the company, Apple's value has reached an estimated $2.4 trillion, and its share price has risen 1,200%, according to BBC.</p>

    <p>Cook, who is estimated to be worth $1.4 billion, still owns 3.2 million shares of the company.</p>

    <p>The regulatory findings also show Cook donated 70,000 shares, worth $10 million, to charity.</p>

    <p>Before joining Apple in 1998, he worked for IBM and Compaq.</p>
