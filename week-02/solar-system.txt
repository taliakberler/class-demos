Solar System

The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and
 the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the 
 objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight
 planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets 
 and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun 
 indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than the smallest 
 planet, Mercury.

The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational 
collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority 
of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the 
remaining mass contained in Jupiter. 

The four smaller inner system planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and 
Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and 
metal. 

The four outer system planets are giant planets, being substantially 
more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter 
and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and 
helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, 
being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting 
points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as 
water, ammonia and methane. 

All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly 
flat disc called the ecliptic.

Asteroid Belt

Asteroids except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as small Solar
 System bodies and are composed mainly of refractory rocky and metallic
  minerals, with some ice. They range from a few metres to hundreds of 
  kilometres in size. Asteroids smaller than one meter are usually 
  called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized), depending on 
  different, somewhat arbitrary definitions.
