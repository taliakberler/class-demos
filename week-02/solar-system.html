        <h1>Solar System</h1>
        
        <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and
        the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the 
        objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight
        planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets 
        and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun 
        indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than the smallest 
        planet, Mercury.</p>


        <p> Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational 
        collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority 
        of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the 
        remaining mass contained in Jupiter.</p>

        <p>The four smaller inner system planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and 
        Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and 
        metal.</p>

        <p>The four outer system planets are giant planets, being substantially 
        more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter 
        and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and 
        helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, 
        being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting 
        points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as 
        water, ammonia and methane.</p>

        <p>All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly 
        flat disc called the ecliptic.</p>

        <h3>Asteroid Belt</h3>

        <!--
        Asteroids except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as small Solar
        System bodies and are composed mainly of refractory rocky and metallic
        minerals, with some ice. They range from a few metres to hundreds of 
        kilometres in size. Asteroids smaller than one meter are usually 
        called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized), depending on 
        different, somewhat arbitrary definitions.
